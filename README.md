# Elec4Midterm Image Processing Pipeline
## A Python-based Image Enhancement and Transformation Toolkit with CI Integration

---

## 📌 Introduction

Elec4Midterm is a Python-based image processing project that applies multiple visual enhancement and transformation techniques to digital images. The project demonstrates modular image processing, automated testing, and continuous integration (CI) using GitHub Actions. Users can apply effects such as beautification, cartoonization, nostalgic filters, brightness enhancement, slow-shutter effects, and image classification in a reproducible and automated way.

This project is designed for academic and practical DevOps learning by combining image processing with automation, testing, and collaborative development workflows.

## 🚀 Project Functionality

The system processes digital images using multiple automated techniques:

* Beautification Enhancement  
* Brightness Adjustment  
* Cartoon Effect Transformation  
* Nostalgic/Vintage Filtering  
* Slow Shutter Motion Blur  
* Image Classification (Candid or Posed)

All processes are automated and produce output images after execution.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

The project follows a modular DevOps-oriented structure:

* **Input images** are stored in the `input/` directory  
* **Processing modules** located in `src/` apply image transformations  
* **Outputs** are saved inside `output/`  
* **Unit tests** validate each processing module  
* **GitHub Actions CI pipeline** automatically validates code changes
